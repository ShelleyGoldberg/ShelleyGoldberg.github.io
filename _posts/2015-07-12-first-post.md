This is my very first blog post. I've never been a blogger before, so I'm not yet sure how seriously to take myself. 

A natural topic for my mid-Summer post seems to be a review of my internship, so...keep reading, I guess.

##So Far, So Good, But I Still Miss What I Know

To this point,  I've had a great experience at Fedex. I'm building a couple of web utilities as part of a big test-automation project. I've been getting a lot of small projects, which has been a double edged sword in terms of knowing what I'm working on each day v. monoty of working on the same task. I enjoy the work I'm doing and have been really excited to dive into AngularJS as a JavaScript novice and to see how quick it can be to spin up a decently interactive website. I have two mentors who've been tasked with keeping me busy and helping me out. They've been doing a great job at being nice to me, even if I'm annoying. They are almost always available to answer my questions, despite half of them being extremely specific or beyond their realms of expertise, as they are both new to Angular as well.  

From June of 2014 to December of 2015, I worked for a small company in Phoenix, Performance Software. I made some pretty good friends, many of whom I see when I'm back home visiting and keep in touch with when I'm away. My internship this summer is much shorter and as such, I haven't had as much interaction with other interns. It probably seems cheesy to be a little bit sad that I don't really have work friends, but studies show that job satisfaction is significantly increased when you have a "work best friend!" That said, I really like the attitude that Fedex seems to have toward interns. I can't even recall how many "come to me if you need anything"s I heard in my first week and how excited everybody is to have us around. 

Biggest pro so far, I'm not bad at my job! That's always my fear- I'll get to a new place and break everything and make everybody hate me. The other day, though, somebody called me "SHELLINATOR" for un-breaking something! This year, though, is almost definitely my last internship. This is my fifth Summer doing something new and the idea of graduating and committing to something long-term is a little scary. I guess my intellectual traipsing led me to choose CS, so it'll prepare me to find something I like and stick with it post-grad as well. 


In conclusion, I'm probably going to be bad at blogging, but I'm not a communications major, so it's chill.
