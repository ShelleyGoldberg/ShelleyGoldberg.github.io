##Wait Summer, Where Are You Going?! Come Back?

I officially have three days of work left, which means that it's time to check in with my summer 2015 to-do list. That's how to-do list work, right? Write them and then ignore them for a couple of months until you decide to see how you did? Whether or not you agree...

###Here's the list:
* Ubuntu-ify netbook
* Train for half marathon
* The Rails Tutorial
* Make a personal website
* Put big projects on GitHub
* Unpack room
* Make a perfect cheesecake
* Revamp resume
* Make something cool-TBD
* Contribute to open source project 
* Pimp out GoLight

###What I've totally done:
* Ubuntu-fiy netbook
* Train for half marathon- *disclaimer:Not planning to run on vacation,
  that's what couches are for*
* Make a personal website- *uh duh, it's a little redundant, no?*
* Unpack room- *I promise there's nothing packed-up about it*
* Revamp resume- *totally done is an overstatment, but it's definitely 
  happening!*
* Make something cool-TBD- *Currently cooking something up with [Pete Mash](https://github.com/petermash)  and [Steve Ellis](https://github.com/saellis), watch out for that sweet app to drop*

###What I've not done so much, but still **learned** from:
* The Rails Tutorial- Well, I haven't technically learned from this one yet, but I have a few days in a house with a napping baby and a few more alone to knock this one out before summer's end.
* Put big projects on GitHub- So the only 'big' projects that aren't up are either course material or verrrry close to course material. What I learned here? I'm not a fan of letting people cheat the university or themselves, so I'll have to continue thinking on whether those will go public, or if I'll just need to do some more 'big' projects.
* Make a perfect cheesecake- I learned that using an oven in a hot apartment just makes an even hotter apartment, so I shall be waiting for the inevitable 9 months of winter to tackle this one.
* Contribute to open source project- I actually got pretty into reading bug report and fix documentation for the mozilla project, but I was using my Ubuntu-ified netbook and do you have any idea what ready pages upon pages of documentation feels like on a tiny screen with a tiny  track pad? Take my word for it: Bad. It feels bad, so I got discouraged.  Hopefully I'll pick this bullet up again soon, because it would be great to dip my hands in cool stuff withouth having to love it for 40hr/week for a couple years. 
* Pimp out GoLight- Here's the thing... What's a software pimp gonna do with an app with a broken leg, arm, and some weird twitches resulting from overly frequent ajax calls which refresh and expand content? This project was amazing for it's lifetime- I improved my python skills, learned JavaScript, figured out how to work on a team & not hate people, and ```<cheese>``` *made friends* ```</cheese>```. However, it's time for GoLight to go into the light or have a total body re-do. It's still [live](http://golight-app.appspot.com) and you'll probably have 2x the number of friends you thought because most users are entered twice somehow #It'sAFeature.


The professional part of my summer is nearly over and all I have is this stupid list to show for it! KIDDING, I accomplished a good number of the tasks on my list and have either plans or excuses for the rest. 


**FYI: My roommate built and customized an entire online portfolio using Wix in the time it took me to make the background and headers/footers of this blue.**
