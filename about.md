I'm a student at the University of Pittsburgh intending to graduate in April 2016 with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Chemistry.

I have been an undergraduate teaching assistant for Intro to CS using Java and Intermediate Java Programming at Pitt since Fall 2014. I just completed an internship with Fedex Services in the Pittsburgh office doing web development for some internal tools. 

When I'm not busy pursuing my degree I like to get involved on campus, work on coding projects with friends, and hike. I'm president of Pitt's chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, Computer Science Honor Society and vice president of Pitt's Women in Computer Science. I am an active member of the service fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, through which I have been heavily involved with [the homelost project](http://homelostproject.org/). 

*Fun fact- I am loosely committed to writing my blog on a netbook from 2009 that I recently switched over to run lubuntu.
