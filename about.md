I'm a student at the University of Pittsburgh intending to graduate in April 2016 with a BS in Computer Science.
I grew up in toasty Phoenix Arizona and grew an appreciation for all things mountainous. 
When I'm not busy pursuing my degree I like to work on coding projects with friends, hike, and explore the world with a tourist's eyes. 

I'm currently interning with Fedex Services in the Pittsburgh office doing web development for some internal tools. 

*Fun fact- I am loosely committed to writing my blog on a netbook from 2009 that I recently switched over to run lubuntu.
